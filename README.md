# download-pdfs
a little command line program to download the pdfs for a given url

## Purpose
A little program I made so I can download the pdf files in a given web page; I often have to do it manually whenever I find course material on the web; for example
I have used this program to get the pdf files from the syllabus for an optimzing compiler course @ cmu.

## how to use this program

`python3 download_pdfs.py <url> <destination-folder>`
